# hello-world
Just doing what is written in guide..trying to be familiar with GitHub :) 
Hey! I'm Darshil. I'm from India. At present, I'm doing Advance Diploma in Computer Systems Technology from Fanshawe College, London, Canada. I'm a beginner with very little knowledge of Coding/Programming but I will learn a lot things from here and that is sure. I found so many things interesting but procrastination is my biggest enemy, but I am determined to defeat it and here I go!!
